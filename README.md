# TomeRater

An application that rates books based on an individual user's input. Ratings include: 
* Most positive user
* Highest rated book
* Most read book

## Project Goals
1. practice implementing classes in Python
2. create methods for 5 different classes that interact with each other
3. exercise knowledge of lists, loops, dictionaries, strings, control flow and more importantly basic Python syntax

5 different classes separated into files:

* TomeRater.py - includes methods for User and Book classes to interact
* User.py - includes a method to get the average rating from all books read by an individual user
* Book.py - includes a method to get the average rating from all users for a particular book
* NonFiction.py - subclass of Book, i.e. child
* Fiction.py - subclass of Book, i.e. child
