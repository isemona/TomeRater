# TomeRater

An application that allows users to read and rate books. Kinda sorta like [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18346324-mona).

## Project Goals
1. practice implementing and testing classes in Python
2. create methods for 5 different classes that interact with each other
3. exercise knowledge of lists, loops, dictionaries, strings, control flow and more importantly basic Python syntax

## Folder structure

* main.py (code for testing)

5 different classes separated into files:

* TomeRater.py - includes methods for User and Book classes to interact
* User.py - includes a method of users with their average rating of books they read 
* Book.py - includes a method of books with their average rating by overall users 
* NonFiction.py - subclass of Book
* Fiction.py - subclass of Book
